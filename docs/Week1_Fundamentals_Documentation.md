# ☕ Week 1: Java Fundamentals - Grade Manager System

## 1. Project Overview and Objectives
The objective of this project was to establish a strong foundation in Java syntax and logic. This project demonstrates the ability to handle user input, perform mathematical calculations, and use conditional logic to drive a program.

### Technical Requirements Met
* **Primitive Data Types:** Used `int`, `double`, and `String` to manage data effectively.
* **Control Flow:** Implemented `if-else` blocks and `switch` statements for decision-making logic.
* **Input/Output:** Utilized the `java.util.Scanner` class to capture real-time user input from the console.

## 2. Setup and Installation Instructions
1. **JDK Version:** Developed using JDK 11+.
2. **IDE:** Project can be opened in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. **Execution:** Run the `GradeManager.java` file. Enter data into the console when prompted by the program.

---

## 3. Code Structure Explanation
The program is structured within a single main class to demonstrate procedural logic within an Object-Oriented environment.

| Component | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scanner Input** | Captures user data (e.g., Student Names, Marks, or Numbers). |
| **Logic Engine** | Processes the input (e.g., calculating averages or performing arithmetic). |
| **Output Formatter** | Displays the final result to the user in a clean, readable format. |

## 4. Data Format Specification
For this basic implementation, data is handled in-memory during runtime.
* **Input Format:** Numerical values (0-100) and String identifiers.
* **Output Format:** Formatted strings printed to the console (e.g., "Final Grade: A").

## 5. Project Workflows
The program follows a linear execution path:
1. **Prompt:** The system asks the user for a specific input.
2. **Read:** The `Scanner` captures the keyboard input.
3. **Validate:** The program checks if the input is within valid ranges (e.g., marks between 0-100).
4. **Calculate:** Logic is applied to determine the outcome.
5. **Display:** The final result is printed to the console.
